## Lecture outline:
- Format of group project
- Collaborating on GitHub:
    - Overview of branches
    - Personal access tokens
    - Starting the project off
        - Start repo off with minimal files (probably just a .gitignore and possibly a README.md file)
        - WARNING: Be mindful of how you all will connect to your databases, use APIs, etc.  (In other words, think about port numbers you all will use, passwords you all use to connect to your databases, etc.  I recommend you all use a .env file that is NOT pushed to GitHub and then bring in stuff as needed.)
        - Making the repository online
        - Creating a branch
        - Making a .gitignore file (especially important for React projects!)
        - Adding project starter files (like folder structure, starter code for React, etc.)
    - Branch protection
    - Adding people to a project
    - Cloning (NOT forking) the project
    - Working on your own branch
    - Pull requests
    - Pulling from the GitHub repo - do this often!!!
    - Resolving merge conflicts
        - Recommendation: Everyone should work on their own files!  I don't advise having two people work on the same file.
