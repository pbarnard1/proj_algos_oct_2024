/*
Skyline Heights
Lovely Burbank has a breathtaking view of the Los Angeles skyline. 
Letâ€™s say you are given an array with heights of consecutive buildings, 
starting closest to you and extending away. Array [-1,7,3] would represent 
three buildings: first is actually out of view below street level, 
behind it is second at 7 stories high, third is 3 stories high 
(hidden behind the 7-story). You are situated at street level. Return array 
containing heights of buildings you can see, in order. Given [-1,1,1,7,3] 
return [1,7]. Given [0,4] return [4]. As always with challenges, do not use 
built-in array functions such as unshift().
