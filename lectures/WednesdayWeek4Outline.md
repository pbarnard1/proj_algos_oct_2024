## Outline:
- Binary search trees:
    - Clarification on balanced vs. full trees
    - Figuring out the size of the tree (the number of nodes)
    - Traversing the tree three different ways:
        - In-order traversal
        - Pre-order traversal
        - Post-order traversal
    - Finding the height of the tree (if we have time; similar to finding size of tree)
    - Level-order traversal (if time permits, which is not likely)
